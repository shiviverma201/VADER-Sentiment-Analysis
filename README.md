# VADER-Sentiment-Analysis
Comparing score of emojis obtained from VADER and Emoji Sentiment Ranking

I have determined the score and
polarity of 751 emoji using a lexicon-based approach called VADER.
VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based method for interpreting the emotions conveyed in social media.
It is a form of sentence level sentiment analysis that incorporates a lexicon and processes the characteristics of the sentence to determine the sentence's polarity.  
Also presents comparative analysis of the scores and the
polarity of emoji obtained by VADER and Emoji Sentiment Ranking.I have used two machine learning approaches that are
linear regression and SVM for comparing the results and VADER shows better results for analyzing the sentiment of emojis.
